# Event propagation

`ClickAwayListener` works by attaching a mouse event listener to the `document`. When an element on a page is clicked, it receives the event and checks whether the `event.target` is inside or outside of `ClickAwayListener`'s contents. If it's outside then we trigger the `onClickAway()` callback.

To determine whether an element is inside `ClickAwayListener`, we ask whether its either inside its DOM tree or the React tree. To check the React tree, we attach another mouse up event handler to `ClickAwayListener`'s child element (in addition to the `document` event listener). When a synthetic React event is captured, we'll ignore the next event coming from the `document` listener, so that `onClickAway()` is not called.

This method works fine for basic use cases, but often we want to stop event propagation from inside `ClickAwayListener`'s React tree without affecting the click away behaviour. To do this we listen to events in their capture phase.

Conceptually, we would like the `ClickAwayListener` to work regardless of the context it appears in. This library aims to work _as if_ browsers provided a native 'click outside' event. For example, we could write `element.addEventListener('clickoutside')`, which wouldn't be affected if an unrelated element on the page called `event.stopPropagation()`.

## Stopping propagation through DOM tree

Stopping event propagation in the bubble phase will not affect the click away listener. The buttons in this example call both `event.stopPropagation()` and `event.nativeEvent.stopImmediatePropagation()` inside onMouseUp (and similar) handlers however clicking outside will still trigger the `onClickAway` callback.

## Stopping propagation through React portals

React events bubble through React portals by default, however this behaviour [is often not desired](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11387), depending on the UI. For example, a full screen modal can be thought of as a visual overlay in the app. If we were to hover over an element inside the modal, we most likely don't want the hover events to bubble up to any elements outside of that modal (outside or underneath the overlay).

However, if we stop propagation of mouse and keyboard events from such UI elements, the `ClickAwayListener` will have no way of finding out whether the `event.target` is inside its React tree. To work around this, we use the capture phase of the native document event to determine that an event occured, and bubble phase of synthetic React events to inform the component about its React tree.

Where the `<StopPropagation>` component is implemented roughly like this:

```js
export const StopPropagation = () => {
  const handleEvent = useCallback(
    (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
      event.stopPropagation();
      event.nativeEvent.stopImmediatePropagation();
    },
    []
  );

  return cloneElement(children, {
      onMouseUp: handleEvent,
      onClick: handleEvent,
      // ...
  }
};
```

## Establishing an overlay

In this example, clicks inside the overlay do not affect click away listeners that exist underneath of the overlay.

## Stopping immediate propagation

Buttons calling `stopPropagation()` or `stopImmediatePropagation` have no effect on the
ClickAwayListener, unless they stop the capture phase.
